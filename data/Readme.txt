1. dataset building

write a paper with a dataet: 
    1. make dataset, identify certain set of features and build dataset
        --> problem is what is the uniqueness? combining two things. why is it better ? 
    2. show a good test case, with those features build better classifier and generative modelling


how to compare performance in generative modelling ? 
regarding a dataset --> lab has tons of data. lab characterize data. all of those data can be compiled into data, we have this interesting dataset 
    with info we have collected, we can use it. 

worried about how can we take that to a paper? 

trying to predict something that has not been predicted
    is the most valuable method

magnetic, chern number or integer quantum hall tate 

predict magnetic higher order  topological insualtor, nobody know about 
    then its valuable


current viewpoint: 
    low computing power
        if using this database one can predict and classify materials on 
            lower  computational cost then that is very valuable

we can predict many topological insualtors 
    but what is the point ? 
        so many topological insualtor, why search for more? 

    one application is building a transistor
        then there are some problems
            will look dif than silicon based one

    will require making electric switch by making 
    

    consider 2D topological insulator, current carrying channels one dge of ssample 
        apply e fieldd and convert topological insualtor into trivial insulator
    
        gate voltage, e field, perfectly conducting channel to carry electricity, apply another e field that channel goes away



what do we need:
    silicon transitor: 0 e field turned off 
    without e field its a trivial insulator (no channel) 
        if apply e field say 5 V its turned on 
        can we apply an e field to make same trivial e field 
            topological insulator


trivial insulator 
apply reaonably small e field to make it topological insualtor

todo that: find such a material in the first place

50 mV 

predict material with certain band gap

my multi task classifier is useful
