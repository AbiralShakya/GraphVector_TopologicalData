JARVIS database used widely for generative models in traditional "AI for materials" resarch groups

Outside of spin orbit coupling data (loosely related but not direct data / ground truth) there's no data on topological 

although topological quantum chemistry database exists with .poscar files of atomic structures, no direct path to retrieve properties from jarvis and directly analyze .poscar files easily of graph structure / lattice structure 

this project aims to combine JARVIS & topological data with a unified graph-vector database structure for further work in generative models for topological materials 


EBR from TQC --> symmetry and interconnections in k space + poscar based lattice structure combined with jarvis data 
    change to vector database (jarvis + TQC regular)
    accompanby with corresponding graph based structure as stated above
