JARVIS database used widely for generative models in traditional "AI for materials" resarch groups

Outside of spin orbit coupling data (loosely related but not direct data / ground truth) there's no data on topological 

although topological quantum chemistry database exists with .poscar files of atomic structures, no direct path to retrive properties from jarvis and directly analyze .poscar files easily of graph structure / lattice structure 

this project aims to combine JARVIS & topological data with a unified graph-vector database structure for further work in generative models for topological materials
